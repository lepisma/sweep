/Sweep/ personal messages from Slack DMs (including deactivated), groups, and
channels. I am using this repository to learn Rust so the code will be in a bad
state.

To use, you will need to create a Slack app with the following permissions on a
/user key/:

- ~channels:history~
- ~groups:history~
- ~im:history~
- ~mpim:history~
- ~chat:write~
- ~chat:write:user~
- ~chat:write:bot~

Then do the following:

#+begin_src shell
  # User ID is to filter your messages. Conversation ID is the ID of the DM,
  # group, or channel to clean up.
  sweep <USER-ID> <CONVERSATION-ID>
#+end_src
