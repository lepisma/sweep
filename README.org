#+TITLE: sweep

Tools for deleting personal data from corporate systems. I am also just trying
to learn Rust so the code will be in a bad state.

As of now sweep only handles Slack self-messages from any dm, group, or channel.
You will need a /user key/ with the following permissions:

- ~channels:history~
- ~groups:history~
- ~im:history~
- ~mpim:history~
- ~chat:write~
- ~chat:write:user~
- ~chat:write:bot~

Then do the following:

#+begin_src shell
  # User ID is to filter your messages. Conversation ID is the ID of the DM,
  # group, or channel to clean up.
  cargo run -- <USER-ID> <CONVERSATION-ID>
#+end_src
